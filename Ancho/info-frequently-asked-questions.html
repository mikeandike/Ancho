That’s about 75% of the total land area. The property has been zoned as planned development since Santee became an incorporated city in 1980.</p>

                  <p>The nature preserve and trails, village centers, community farm and multiple parks including dog parks will be available for everyone to enjoy. We have also engaged in discussions with the City to gain a mutual understanding of how the development of Fanita Ranch can help to facilitate the implementation of a long-awaited local branch library and a senior center. We are striving to make Fanita Ranch a well-integrated addition to Santee, not a separate community.</p>

              <div class="col-md-8 pane">
                  <p>In November of 2018, the City announced a Notice of Preparation for a
                  Draft Environmental Impact Report for the Fanita Ranch project. This is the beginning of the City’s formal - and public - review and approval process. During the EIR phase, the City and independent research professionals
                  dig into every potential impact from Fanita Ranch, as well as the project’s planned mitigations, improvements and benefits to the City. Subjects
                  for study include traffic, quality of life, socio-economic impacts, cultural heritage, and of course environmental factors. This process is long, thorough and spelled out in accordance with California’s stringent Environmental Quality Act. We expect a draft report to be complete in late summer 2019.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="col-md-8 pane">
                  <p>After Fanita Ranch is granted approval and all necessary building permits, the first phase of construction will be roughly one half of the Orchard Village neighborhood, including the farm, K-8 school site, fire station site and several hundred homes. Simultaneously, improvements to Highway 52 will be built, so that these important upgrades are completed by the time the first residents move in.</p>

              <div class="col-md-8 pane">
                  <p>The new homes at Fanita Ranch will not all be built at once, but in phases. It’s very typical for communities like this one to be built over the course
of one or two decades. Steady, paced building allows us to minimize construction impacts and provide community and public amenities when they’re needed and make financial sense. If the project stays on track, we expect the first home to be completed in 3-4 years.</p>

                  <p>Aside from the 55+ active adult neighborhood that will be part of Fanita Ranch, fees and taxes contributed by HomeFed can provide the capital needed to construct a new senior center that has long been desired in Santee, for all the city’s residents to use.</p>

              <div class="col-md-8 pane">
                  <p>Our project team has had numerous discussions with the Grossmont Union High School District and they have assured us that the existing local high schools will have ample capacity to take on new students from Fanita Ranch. Fanita Ranch won’t be adding thousands of new students to the two local high schools all at once. Enrollment will be spread out over a number of years. By the time students from Fanita Ranch start going to local high schools, there will be ample seats available.</p>

                  <p>Yes, HomeFed has already met and consulted with members of the local Native American tribes regarding sites of cultural importance at Fanita Ranch, as well as traditional uses of the property and native plants and wildlife. Fanita Ranch’s trail and parks system may include informational signage or exhibits highlighting traditional Native American uses.</p>

              <div class="col-md-8 pane">
                  <p>Sustainability is a core focus of our plan for Fanita Ranch, and a small, on-site solar farm will produce power for new homes and businesses. The solar farm will not be significantly visible from existing homes because it’s nestled on
a plot located above those neighborhoods, substantially out of neighbors’ sightlines. As we developed our improved plans for Fanita Ranch, it was
very important to us to make sure that current residents on the property’s southern border will not have their views significantly impacted.</p>

              <div class="col-md-8 pane">
                  <p>Fanita Parkway will be widened from a 2-lane road to a 4-lane road between Mast Boulevard and Lake Canyon Road, and then widened to a 3-lane
road from Lake Canyon to Ganley Road. Magnolia Avenue will also see improvements and will be extended from a dead-end street to intersect with Cuyamaca Street, to provide an additional, critical egress point in
case of emergency. Cuyamaca will also be extended into the Fanita Ranch property and used as the primary entrance. On Highway 52, HomeFed
will move the existing bike lane to the eastbound side of the highway and create an additional westbound lane to improve the flow of traffic moving up the hill and away from the city. HomeFed will also create an additional lane on the San Diego River Bridge heading eastbound. Importantly, plans also call for updating the Mast Boulevard on-ramp to Highway 52 to a high- capacity on-ramp, which will relieve the morning back-up of cars merging onto 52. Overall, these improvements will increase capacity on the 52 - adding 4 times the capacity that Fanita Ranch will generate at build out.

                  <p>So far, HomeFed has spent nearly three million dollars to evaluate potential roadway improvements, both for SR-52 and city streets. When it comes to addressing traffic on SR-52, state and federal funding is also being pursued. If that outside funding doesn’t come through, HomeFed is prepared to pay for these important planned improvements itself - namely the addition of a westbound lane from the Mast Boulevard onramp to I-15, and an additional estabound lane over the San Diego River Bridge.</p>

              <div class="col-md-8 pane">
                  <p>Yes. Traffic improvements to SR-52 - including the addition of one westbound and one eastbound lane - will be complete before the first resident may move into new homes at Fanita Ranch. This obligation will be spelled out in a formal legal agreement with the City of Santee, ensuring SR- 52 upgrades are finished according to this schedule.</p>

              <div class="col-md-8 pane">
                  <p>Yes, that work is underway. We realize it’s one thing to hear about these improvements, but it’s a completely different thing to see what those changes will look like. That’s why we’re creating a simulation of the current traffic conditions and infrastructure, as well as our planned enhancements, so local residents can see how things will change and improve.</p>

              <div class="col-md-8 pane">
                  <p>That is an option we are studying and considering. Our current plan calls for adding a westbound lane from Mast Boulevard to Interstate 15. This new lane could become a dedicated truck lane, which could help keep slower traffic from backing up other lanes as they climb up the hill on Highway 52 away from Santee.</p>

              <div class="col-md-8 pane">
                  <p>In short, SR-52 improvements won’t be completed for decades if Fanita Ranch is denied, leaving today’s traffic problems to persist. An impact analsyis report commissioned by the City found that without Fanita Ranch, there is no alternative funding source for upgrades to SR-52. CalTrans’ plans for the freeway corridor aren’t scheduled to take place until around 2050.

                  <p>This is something we looked at long and hard as an option for offsetting new car trips from Fanita Ranch. After 18 months of meeting with Caltrans, SANDAG and property owners about connecting Fanita Ranch with Highway 67, no viable solution was identified. There are challenges and constraints that make this connection infeasible, including steep grades, poor soils and private property owners unwilling to sell or cooperate.</p>

as part of the project’s Environmental Impact Report. If studies show a widened Fanita Parkway, Cuyamaca Street, or Magnolia Avenue will create more noise than allowed under law, we will work with sound engineers and local residents to find a workable solution, which may include some kind of physical sound barrier.</p>

or access local trails. Orchard Village homes will be a little larger and cater to young families and empty nesters. The homes in Vineyard Village will
be the largest, catering to families that need room to grow. Across the neighborhoods there will be a variety of home styles to choose from that fit Fanita Ranch’s desired agrarian feel.</p>

While regulations only require a single lane, we want to ensure that evacuation routes are more than is needed in case of emergency.
